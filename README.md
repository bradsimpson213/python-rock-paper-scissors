# BONUS Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors! 🪨 📃 ✂️

 Program Rock, Paper, Scissors against the computer using OOP principles (and classes)!  Here are the specifications:

- 1. Define a class named "RPS" that should have the following attribites:
  - a. A number of players (integar) that is set to 1 by default.
  - b. A number of rounds (integar) that is set to 3 by default.
  - c. A number of player wins, that is set to 0.
  - d. A number of computer wins, that is set to 0.
- 2. Define a function named "play_rock_paper_scissors" that takes in one
     arguement, which should be an integar value for the number of rounds to
     play.
- 3. Check to make sure the integar value passed in as the arguement to
     "play_rock_paper_scissors" is an odd number (so there will have to be a
     winner decided).
- 4. Get user/player input and save it to a variable.  Input must be in the
     format of "Rock", "Paper", or "Scissors".
- 5. Generate a random play from the computer (picking one from a list or other
     appropraite data structure containing "Rock, Paper, Scissors" to put up
     against the user/player input).

  Hints:  Maybe make a helper function to generate the computers choice
  and/or to determine who wins each round.
